# ICEBERG – Automated CVE Intelligence

ICEBERG is an automated vulnerability intelligence pipeline that correlates:

- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
- Exploit-DB
- GitHub Proof-of-Concept signals

The objective is to prioritize **real-world exploitable risk**, not just CVSS scores.
